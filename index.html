                    <h4>Pranav & Nikita</h4>
                    <p>Still in India, where arranged marriages were the norm, a remarkable love story unfolded that
                        defied all conventions. It all began on a typical day when destiny brought together two souls
                        through a popular matrimonial website called Shaadi.com. Little did we know that our encounter
                        would lead us down a path less traveled, filled with love, understanding, and a shared passion
                        of spirituality.Lucky to call myself the protagonist of this story, Pranav, I am a young man
                        with dreams as vast as the night sky and hopelessly optimistic about anything and everything.

                    <h4>Heena & Chause</h4>
                    <p>We had initially sent requests to each other, and Heena declined my request because her bucket
                        list already had many
                        people. However, unknowingly, she rejected it, and that's how our slow communication began. It
                        took around 1 to 2 weeks
                        of regular chatting before we started having calls. When trust started to build, we began
                        communicating through WhatsApp
                        audio calls instead of regular calls, as Heena wasn't comfortable sharing her number so quickly.

                    <h4>Prerana & Neeraj</h4>
                    <p>It was a very good experience for me. We matched on Shadi.com and hit it off with first meeting
                        itself. The
                        compatibility with the partner is very important and finding the like-minded matches is quite
                        crucial. I think this app
                        has made this possible. Thanks team for making it possible to find me the match I was looking
                        for.</p>
